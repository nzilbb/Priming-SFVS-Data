# Sld-R-Data

This repository contains data for the under-review paper "Intraspeaker priming across the New Zealand English short front vowel shift." The data consists of 91,146 short front vowel tokens from New Zealand English, from the [QuakeBox corpus](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amper.2016.01.001). Of these, the final model was modeled on 59,824 tokens due to various exclusions (e.g., outliers were excluded); information on which tokens were analyzed in the final model is encoded in the column `In_Mod`. To ensure anonymity, the Word column has been replaced with anonymous codes, and the SpkrCode column uses anonymized QuakeBox codes.

The data is in two formats: .Rds (for use in the R statistical computing environment) and .csv (with blanks for what are called `NA`s in R parlance).
